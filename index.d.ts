/*
 * Re-export all the type definitions that wasm-bindgen generated for us.
 *
 * We do this by referring to a non-existent "matrix_sdk_crypto_wasm.js" file. This works because TSC will automatically
 * transform this into the correct name "matrix_sdk_crypto_wasm.d.ts" [1].
 *
 * Other alternatives don't work:
 *
 *  - `export * from "./pkg/matrix_sdk_crypto_wasm.d.ts"`: You're not allowed to `import from "<foo>.d.ts"`
 *    without `import type`, because normally, that would mean you don't get the runtime definitions that are in
 *    "<foo>.js". This lint rule even applies to ".d.ts" files, which is arguably overzealous, but there you have it.
 *
 *  - `export type * from "./pkg/matrix_sdk_crypto_wasm.d.ts"`: Doing this means you can't call the constructors on any
 *    of the exported types: `new RoomId(...)` gives a build error.
 *
 *  - `export * from "./pkg/matrix_sdk_crypto_wasm"`: This works in *some* environments, but in others, typescript
 *    complains [2]. We could maybe get around this by mandating a `moduleResolution` setting of `bundler` or so, but
 *    that is restrictive on our downstreams.
 *
 * A final alternative would be just to cat `matrix_sdk_crypto_wasm.d.ts` in here as part of the build script, but
 * for now at least we're trying to avoid too much file manipulation.
