# `matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm`

Welcome to the [WebAssembly] + JavaScript binding for the Rust
[`matrix-sdk-crypto`] library! WebAssembly can run anywhere, but these
bindings are designed to run on a JavaScript host. These bindings are
part of the [`matrix-rust-sdk`] project, which is a library
implementation of a [Matrix] client-server.

`matrix-sdk-crypto` is a no-network-IO implementation of a state
machine, named `OlmMachine`, that handles E2EE ([End-to-End
Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-to-end_encryption)) for
[Matrix] clients.

## Usage

1. Install in your project:

    ```
    npm install --save @matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm
    ```

    or:

    ```
    yarn add @matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm
    ```

2. Import the library into your project and initialise it.

    On Web platforms, the library must be initialised by calling `initAsync`
    before it can be used, else it will throw an error. This is also recommended
    on other platforms, as it allows the WebAssembly module to be loaded
    asynchronously.

    ```javascript
    import { initAsync, Tracing, LoggerLevel, OlmMachine, UserId, DeviceId } from "@matrix-org/matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm";

    async function loadCrypto(userId, deviceId) {
        // Do this before any other calls to the library
        await initAsync();

        // Optional: enable tracing in the rust-sdk
        new Tracing(LoggerLevel.Trace).turnOn();

        // Create a new OlmMachine
        //
        // The following will use an in-memory store. It is recommended to use
        // indexedDB where that is available.
        // See https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/classes/OlmMachine.html#initialize
        const olmMachine = await OlmMachine.initialize(new UserId(userId), new DeviceId(deviceId));

        return olmMachine;
    }
    ```

    See the [API documentation](https://matrix-org.github.io/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/) for more information.

3. Build your project.

    The packaging of this library aims to "just work" the same as any plain-javascript project would: it includes
    separate entry points for Node.js-like environments (which read the WASM file via
    [`fs.readFile()`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fsreadfilepath-options-callback)) and web-like environments (which
    download the WASM file with [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/fetch)). There are
    both CommonJS and ES Module entry points for each environment; an appropriate entrypoint should be selected
    automatically.

    If your environment supports the experimental [ES Module Integration Proposal for WebAssembly](https://github.com/WebAssembly/esm-integration),
    you can instead use that, by setting the `matrix-org:wasm-esm` custom [export condition](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports).
    This is only supported when the library is imported as an ES Module. For example:

    - In Webpack, set [`experiments.asyncWebAssembly`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/experiments/#experiments)
      to `true` and [`resolve.conditionNames`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolveconditionnames)
      to `["matrix-org:wasm-esm", "..."]` (the `"..."` preserves default condition names).
    - In Node.js, invoke with commandline arguments [`--experimental-wasm-modules`](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#wasm-modules)
      [`--conditions=wasm-esm`](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#-c-condition---conditionscondition).

## Building matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm

These WebAssembly bindings are written in [Rust]. To build them, you
need to install the Rust compiler, see [the Install Rust
Page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). Then, the workflow is
pretty classical by using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), see [the Downloading and installing
Node.js and npm
Page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) and [installing yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install).

Once the Rust compiler, Node.js and yarn are installed, you can run the
following commands:

```sh
$ yarn install
$ yarn build  # or 'yarn build:dev' to make an unoptimised build
$ yarn test
```

The compiled output should be generated in the `pkg/` directory.

## Local development with matrix-rust-sdk

To build based on a local `matrix-rust-sdk`, add something like this to your
`.cargo/config` file:

```
[patch.'https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk']
matrix-sdk-base = { path = "../matrix-rust-sdk/crates/matrix-sdk-base" }
matrix-sdk-common = { path = "../matrix-rust-sdk/crates/matrix-sdk-common" }
matrix-sdk-crypto = { path = "../matrix-rust-sdk/crates/matrix-sdk-crypto" }
matrix-sdk-indexeddb = { path = "../matrix-rust-sdk/crates/matrix-sdk-indexeddb" }
matrix-sdk-qrcode = { path = "../matrix-rust-sdk/crates/matrix-sdk-qrcode" }
```
