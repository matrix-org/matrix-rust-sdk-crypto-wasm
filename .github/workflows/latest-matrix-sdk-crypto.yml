name: Build against latest matrix-sdk-crypto

# Runs a nightly job that builds this project against the latest version of
# matrix-sdk-crypto to find out whether some changes there have modified
# interfaces we are relying on.
#
# It does this by effectively doing:
#
#     cargo update matrix-sdk-crypto
#     yarn build
#
# If the build fails, this action:
#
# * creates an issue in this project's repo (or updates an existing open issue)
# * adds a comment to the issue linking to the specific build failure
# * sends a message to the Crypto team's Matrix room
