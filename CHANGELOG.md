# UNRELEASED

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v14.0.1

-   Fix a problem, introduced in v14.0.0, which could cause WASM runtime errors
    if the `OlmMachine` was freed while an operation was in flight.
    ([#205](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/205)),
    ([#206](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/206))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v14.0.0

-   `CollectStrategy.deviceBasedStrategy` is deprecated, and replaced by other methods in `CollectStrategy`.
    ([#194](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/194))

-   **BREAKING**: Improve generated typescript types (`Promise<T>` instead of
    `Promise<any>`, etc).
    ([#193](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/193))

-   Fix a problem, introduced in v12.0.0, when importing the published package as an ESM module, in which some files could be incorrectly interpreted as CommonJS, leading to syntax errors.
    ([#189](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/189))

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `0.10.0`, which includes:

    -   Accept stable identifier `sender_device_keys` for MSC4147 (Including device
        keys with Olm-encrypted events).
        ([#4420](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4420))

    -   Room keys are not shared with unsigned dehydrated devices.
        ([#4551](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/4551))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v13.0.0

-   Update matrix-rusk-sdk to `0.9.0`.
-   Expose new API `DehydratedDevices.getDehydratedDeviceKey`, `DehydratedDevices.saveDehydratedDeviceKey`
    and `DehydratedDevices.deleteDehydratedDeviceKey` to store/load the dehydrated device pickle key.
    ([#179](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/179))

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   `DehydratedDevices.keysForUpload` and `DehydratedDevices.rehydrate` now use a `DehydratedDeviceKey` as parameter
    instead of a raw `UInt8Array`. Use `DehydratedDeviceKey.createKeyFromArray` to migrate.
    ([#179](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/179))

**Other changes**

-   Add `OlmMachine.registerRoomKeysWithheldCallbacks` that supports now a success and error callback.
    An error will occur when the stream missed some updates; in that case decryption could be retried
    for all current failures.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v12.1.0

-   Update matrix-rusk-sdk to `37c17cf854a70f` for the fix for
    https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/4424

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v12.0.0

-   Update matrix-rusk-sdk to `e99939db857ca`.
-   The published package is now a proper dual CommonJS/ESM package.
-   The WebAssembly module is now loaded using `fetch` on Web platforms, reducing
    the bundle size significantly, as well as the time it takes to compile it.
    ([#167](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/167)),
    ([#174](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/174)),
    ([#175](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/175))

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   The WebAssembly module is no longer synchronously loaded on Web platforms
    when used. This means that the `initAsync` function **must** be called before any
    other functions are used. The behaviour is unchanged and still available on
    Node.js.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v11.0.0

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `70bcddfba5e19`.

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   Remove `SignedCurve25519` variant of `DeviceKeyAlgorithm`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v10.1.0

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `ce9dc73376b4ee`
-   Update other dependencies

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v10.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   Rename `DecryptionErrorCode.SenderIdentityPreviouslyVerified` to
    `SenderIdentityVerificationViolation` (in line with changes to
    matrix-rust-sdk).

-   Rename `UserIdentity` to `OtherUserIdentity` (in line with changes
    to matrix-rust-sdk).

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `3558886b9`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v9.1.0

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `866b6e5f`, which includes:

    -   Change the withheld code for keys not shared due to the `IdentityBasedStrategy`, from `m.unauthorised` to `m.unverified`.
        ([#3985](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3985))

    -   Improve logging for undecryptable Megolm events.
        ([#3989](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3989))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v9.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   The `SenderIdentityNotTrusted` value in the `DecryptionErrorCode` was
    replaced with `UnknownSenderDevice`, `UnsignedSenderDevice`, and
    `SenderIdentityPreviouslyVerified` to allow the application to distinguish
    between the different reasons that the sender identity is not trusted.

**Other changes**

-   Add `OlmMachine.markAllTrackedUsersAsDirty` to invalidate the device lists
    for all known users. This is required for [MSC4186](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-spec-proposals/pull/4186)
    clients as the server may give up trying to persist device list updates for
    the client at some point, after which the client must treat all devices as dirty.

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `2408df8bf`. No changes relevant to these bindings.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v8.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   The format for `EncryptionSettings.sharingStrategy` has changed. It must
    now be created using the `CollectStrategy.deviceBasedStrategy(...)` or
    `CollectStrategy.identityBasedStrategy()` functions.
    ([#141](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/141))
-   The `OlmMachine.decryptRoomEvent` has a new `DecryptionSettings` parameter
    that allows specifying the required sender trust level. If the trust level
    is not met, the decryption will fail. To replicate the old behaviour, use a
    sender trust level of `TrustRequirement.Untrusted`.
    ([#141](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/141))

**Security Fixes**

-   Fix `UserIdentity.isVerified` to take into account our own identity
    [#d8d9dae](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/commit/d8d9dae9d77bee48a2591b9aad9bd2fa466354cc) (Moderate, [GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-4qg4-cvh2-crgg)).

**Other changes**

-   Add `(Own)UserIdentity.wasPreviouslyVerified()`,
    `(Own)UserIdentity.withdrawVerification()`, and
    `(Own)UserIdentity.hasVerificationViolation()` to check and manage the state
    of users who were previously verified but are no longer verified.
    ([#141](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/141))
-   Add `UserIdentity.pinCurrentMasterKey()` and
    `UserInfo.identityNeedsUserApproval()` to manage user identity changes.
    ([#141](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/141))
-   `ShieldState` has a new `code` property that is set when the shield state is
    not `None`.
    ([#141](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/141))
-   Add a new API `Device.encryptToDeviceEvent` to encrypt a to-device message using
    Olm.
    ([#101](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/101))

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `07aa6d7bc`, which includes:

    -   **NOTE**: this version causes changes to the format of the serialised
        data in the CryptoStore, meaning that, once upgraded, it will not be
        possible to roll back applications to earlier versions without breaking
        user sessions.

    -   Miscellaneous improvements to logging for verification and
        `OwnUserIdentity` updates.
        ([#3949](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3949))

    -   Add message IDs to all outgoing encrypted to-device messages.
        ([#3776](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3776))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v7.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   `EncryptionSettings.onlyAllowTrustedDevices` has been replaced with
    `EncryptionSettings.sharingStrategy`, which adds the ability to share only
    with cross-signed devices.
    ([#134](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/134))

**Other changes**

-   Add `OlmMachine.registerRoomKeysWithheldCallback` to notify when we are
    told that room keys have been withheld.
    ([#136](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/136))

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `d9b2b53f8`, which includes:

    -   refactor(sdk-crypto): Room key sharing, introduce extensible strategy
        ([#3605](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3605))

    -   Log the content of received `m.room_key.withheld` to-device events.
        ([#3591](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3591))

    -   Attempt to decrypt bundled events (reactions and the latest thread reply) if they are found in the unsigned part of an event.
        ([#3468](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3468))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v6.1.0

-   Set "creation time" of `OlmAccount`s which were migrated from legacy libolm data to the unix epoch, instead of "now". Fixes https://github.com/element-hq/element-web/issues/27590.
    ([#128](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/128))

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `a2235d50c`. No changes relevant to these bindings.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v6.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   Rename the `QrCodeData` related methods so they use camel case.
    ([0d58c688d](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/commit/0d58c688454d40269d93fc4f763b2d1a754ace9d))

-   Rename the `QrCodeData.homeserver_url` method to `QrCodeData.server_name`
    to reflect the changed data stored in the QR code.
    ([#124](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/124))

-   Update matrix-rust-sdk to `9b05d0d82`, which includes:

    -   `Device.requestVerification`, `UserIdentities.requestVerification`, and
        `UserIdentities.verificationRequestContent` is not async anymore.
        ([#3513](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3513))

    -   Use the server name in the `QrCodeData` instead of the homeserver URL.
        ([#3537](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3537))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v5.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

    -   Avoid emitting entries from `identities_stream_raw` and `devices_stream` when
        we receive a `/keys/query` response which shows that no devices changed.
        ([#3442](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/3442)).

    -   Fix to a bug introduced in matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v4.10.0 which caused

    ([#72](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/72))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v4.0.0

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   Rename `OlmMachine.init_from_store` introduced in v3.6.0 to
    `OlmMachine.initFromStore`.
    ([#84](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/84))

-   Functions/methods that take a JavaScript `Array` as argument now invalidate the
    items within that array so that they cannot be re-used as soon as
    they are received by the functions/methods. See the patch for affected methods.
    ([#82](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/82/))

**Other changes**

-   Update `wasm-bindgen` to 0.2.89. It allows to remove the `downcast` method.
    It fixes [#51](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/51),
    thus the resulting JavaScript code of `matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm` can
    be minified with no issue now.
    ([#82](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/82/))

-   Report failures to callback when importing backed-up room keys. The
    `progress_listener` callback in the `OlmMachine.importBackedUpRoomKeys`
    function is now called with a third argument, giving the number of invalid
    room keys.
    ([#85](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/85))

    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2902](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2902))

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.2.0

-   Add `timeout_secs` parameters to `OlmMachine.get_user_devices` and
    `OlmMachine.get_device`. ([#60](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk-crypto-wasm/pull/60))

-   Improve efficiency of IndexedDB storage of `inbound_group_sessions`.

-   Various clarifications to the log messages written during encryption operations.
    ([matrix-rust-sdk#2859](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/pull/2859))

-   `OlmMachine.importRoomKeys` is now deprecated in favour of separate
    methods for importing room keys from backup and export,
    `OlmMachine.importBackedUpRoomKeys` and
    `OlmMachine.importExportedRoomKeys`.

-   Minor improvements to the formatting of messages logged to the console.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.1

**BREAKING CHANGES**

-   `OlmMachine.bootstrapCrossSigning` no longer returns an array of request
    objects. Rather, it returns a new class (`CrossSigningBootstrapRequests`)
    which contains the request objects within it.

    As part of this work, `SigningKeysUploadRequest` (which was one of the
    types formerly returned by `bootstrapCrossSigning`) has been renamed to
    `UploadSigningKeysRequest` for consistency with the underlying SDK.

## Other changes

-   Devices which have exhausted their one-time-keys will now be correctly
    handled in `/keys/claim` responses (we will register them as "failed" and
    stop attempting to send to them for a while.)

-   Olm decryption operations will no longer log large quantities of data about
    the data `Store`.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v3.0.0

Do not use this release. It has a [critical bug](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk/issues/2802).

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.2.0

-   Added bindings versions details to `getVersions()`. Two new fields `git_sha` and

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.1

## Changes in the underlying Rust crate

-   Clean up the logging of to-device messages in `share_room_key`. Also fixes

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.1.0

-   Attach message IDs to outgoing to-device messages, and log the IDs on
    incoming messages.

-   Improve logging output to include more information, including data that is
    attached to tracing spans. Remove the `tracing` feature: tracing support is
    now always included.

-   BugFix: `ToDeviceRequest` returned by `shareRoomKey(..)` always had an `undefined` `id` field.

# matrix-sdk-crypto-wasm v2.0.0
